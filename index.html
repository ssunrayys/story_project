            <p>Once upon a time, in a far - off land, there lived a great king named <span class='accent'>${mainPerson}</span>. He was loved by his people for his <span class='accent'>${listOfqualitywithspace}</span>. One day, a group of bandits attacked the kingdom and stole the crown jewels. <span class='accent'>${mainPerson}</span> knew he needed to act fast, so he summoned his trusted warriors: <span class='accent'>${listOfwarriorswithspace}</span> to help him track down the bandits.</p > 
            <p>Together, <span class='accent'>${countWarriors}</span> heroes set out on a perilous journey through treacherous terrain and dangerous forests. Along the way, they encountered a group of skilled archers led by the brave warrior, <span class='accent'>${heroes.archer}</span>. She joined them in their quest to retrieve the stolen jewels.</p> 
            <p>As they journeyed deeper into the wilderness, they encountered a fierce dragon that had been terrorizing nearby villages. With the help of the powerful wizard, <span class='accent'>${heroes.magician}</span>, they were able to defeat the dragon and save the villages from further destruction.</p> 
            <p>Finally, after many battles and challenges, the heroes arrived at the bandits hideout. With the help of the skilled thief, <span class='accent'>${heroes.thief}</span>, they were able to sneak into the hideout undetected and retrieve the crown jewels.</p>
            <p>The people of the kingdom rejoiced as <span class='accent'>${mainPerson + ', ' + listOfwarriorswithspace + ', ' + heroes.archer + ', ' + heroes.magician + ' and ' + heroes.thief}</span> returned with the stolen jewels. The heroes were hailed as saviors and celebrated with a grand feast in their honor.</p>`;
