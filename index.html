    <title>Story of Aragon</title>
</head>
<body>
    <p>Once upon a time, in a far-off land, there lived a great king named Aragorn. He was loved by his people for his bravery,
    wisdom, and kindness. One day, a group of bandits attacked the kingdom and stole the crown jewels. Aragorn knew he
    needed to act fast, so he summoned his trusted warriors, Legolas and Gimli, to help him track down the bandits.</p>
    <p>Together, the three heroes set out on a perilous journey through treacherous terrain and dangerous forests. Along the
    way, they encountered a group of skilled archers led by the brave warrior, Katniss Everdeen. She joined them in their
    quest to retrieve the stolen jewels.</p>
    <p>As they journeyed deeper into the wilderness, they encountered a fierce dragon that had been terrorizing nearby
    villages. With the help of the powerful wizard, Gandalf, they were able to defeat the dragon and save the villages from
    further destruction.</p>
    <p>Finally, after many battles and challenges, the heroes arrived at the bandits' hideout. With the help of the skilled
    thief, Robin Hood, they were able to sneak into the hideout undetected and retrieve the crown jewels.</p>
    <p>The people of the kingdom rejoiced as Aragorn, Legolas, Gimli, Katniss, Gandalf, and Robin Hood returned with the stolen
    jewels. The heroes were hailed as saviors and celebrated with a grand feast in their honor.</p>
    <p>From that day on, the kingdom was safe and prosperous, and the heroes were forever remembered as the ones who saved the
    day.</p>
